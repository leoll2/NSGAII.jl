# About

This is a fork of the implementation of NSGA-II by gsoleilhac for my academic experiments.
This repo isn't meant to be interesting, not yet at least, so ignore it.
If you are here, probably you're looking for a working NSGA-II implementation: please check https://github.com/gsoleilhac/NSGAII.jl.
